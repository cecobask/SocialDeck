# Assignment 1 - Agile Software Practice

Name: Tsvetoslav Dimov

## Overview

SocialDeck is currently an API that enables users to manage their posts (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Share). It uses GraphQL, instead of REST because of the following reasons:
  - Declarative data fetching: there's no need to call multiple endpoints to access various data, like with traditional REST approach. Instead, you specify the exact data you need and GraphQL gives you exactly what you asked for.
  - Improved performance: GraphQL improves performance by helping avoid round trips to the server and reducing payload size. If one want to take advantage of GraphQL, they don't even have to scrape their existing REST API, as GraphQL can be built on top of REST.
  - GraphQL was developed by Facebook and it's currently open-sourced. It's quickly gaining popularity. A few of its the most notable users are Airbnb, GitHub, The New York Times, Coursera.

## API endpoints
GraphQL is typically served over HTTP via a single endpoint which expresses the full set of capabilities of the service.
This is in contrast to REST APIs which expose a suite of URLs each of which expose a single resource.

The GraphQL endpoint for my API is '/graphql'.

GraphQL comes with an in-browser API explorer. If you navigate to /graphql endpoint in your browser, you will see it in action.
There you can check all existing queries and mutations if you click on the button **DOCS**, located on the right side of the page.
Underneath it you will see another button **SCHEMA**, which will show you the full API schema.
It’s also possible to write queries and mutations directly on the left tab and check their execution by clicking the **PLAY** icon in the middle of the screen.

If you'd like to see a video demo of the Explorer and API calls, [CLICK HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLLi0NRc-g&feature=youtu.be).

* __Queries__
    * users: [User!]! - Gets a list of all users.
    * findUserById(_id: String!): User! - Finds a user by ID.
    * me: User! - Gets currently authenticated user.
    * posts: [Post!]! - Gets a list of all user posts.
    * findPostById(_id: String!): Post! - Finds a post by ID.

* __Mutations__
    * signUp(email: EmailAddress!, password: String!, firstName: String!, lastName: String!): String! - Takes in the specified arguments, creates a new user and signs them in.
    * logIn(email: EmailAddress!, password: String!): String! - Takes in the specified arguments and logs the user in.
    * logOut: String! - Logs out currently authenticated user, if present. Returns a request status message.
    * deleteUserById(_id: String!): User! - Deletes a user by its ID. Returns the deleted document.
    * deleteAllUsers: String! - Deletes all users. Returns a request status message.
    * createPost(message: String, links: [LinkInput!]): Post! - Takes in the specified arguments and creates a new post. Returns the created document.
    * sharePost(postID: String!): Post! - Adds the ID of currently authenticated user to the *shares* array of the specified posts. Returns the shared post document.
    * updatePost(postID: String!, message: String!, links: [LinkInput!]): Post! - Takes in the specified arguments to update an existing post. Returns the updated document.
    * deletePostById(_id: String!): Post! - Deletes a post by its ID. Returns the deleted document.
    * deleteAllPosts: String! - Deletes all posts. Returns a request status message.

## Data model
Simply put, the database stores users and their posts.

The `password` field is an encrypted value of their original password, created by a package called *bcrypt*.
It is then use to verify if hashed value of the original password matches the provided password argument to mutations
like logIn() and signUp().

The `email` field should be an email address of valid format. If it is not, the API will complain and not perform the
creation of User object.

Posts and Users are stored in separate databases.
Using GraphQL I was able to make a connection between a Users and their Posts. I use the User's `_id` to fetch their
Posts collection from the database and populate it as the value of `posts` array in the User objects.

Each Post object has a field `creatorID`, which references a value from the User database.

The `createdTime` and `updatedTime` fields are generated by a package called 'moment'. It gets the current date and time
and stores it in UTC format, keeping the local time. Initially `updateTime` would null, but once a Post gets updated,
this value changes to the exact time when the update happened.

The `links` field stores array of URLs and they are checked if they are of valid URL format before being saved to the database.

The `shares` field stores an array of Users `_id` values. Initially it is null, until the Post object gets shared by a User.
